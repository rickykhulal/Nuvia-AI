# **App Name**: AIVA

## Core Features:

- Natural Language Chat: Natural Language Chat: Acts as a general-purpose assistant using OpenAI GPT-4.5, capable of long-form reasoning, creative writing, coding, and translation. A prompt system structures the interaction with AIVA by providing the user input in the context of AIVA's identity as a smart and friendly assistant, along with relevant user profile information and goals. The tool will then decide whether to incorporate some of the user's information when creating a response.
- Smart Productivity Toolbox: Smart Productivity Toolbox: Integrates productivity tools such as a to-do assistant (task creation, prioritization, and scheduling), a document summarizer (PDF/Word summaries), a memory mode (saves user prompts/answers), and a reminder bot (push/email reminders).
- Multimodal Input: Multimodal Input: Supports text, voice (voice-to-text via Whisper or browser API), image (analysis for text, objects, charts), and file (PDF/CSV processing) inputs, expanding the ways users can interact with AIVA.
